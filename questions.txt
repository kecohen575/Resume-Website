Questions/Curiosities Remainiing:
- File structure?
- <meta> description on one line for SEO or broken for 
human readability and style adherence?
- Nav bar and footer are shared on each page. Best practice for reusability
instead of rewriting for each page?
- Not super clear on semantic difference between <section> and <article>
- Does each page / html file need the same meta info in <head>?
    - Should each page have an appropriate title or be consistent with homepage?
- aria-label usage in nav bar (index.html)
- Can I have an <h1> in <header> and one in <body>, or just one for the whole page?
    - What about in footer? One in each?
- Want to talk more about the capitilzation of text in anticipation of styles vs semantic meaning
- We do a lot to prepare for JS malfunctions, but what about CSS? How good should raw html look?
- I want to add a file to hold all text used on the site. Is this wise, or overengineering?


Concerns:
- I'm concerned the homepage is just a bunch of nav buttons at the end of the day


Ideas:
- 2P mode using windows mechanic I experimented with? What would it do tho...
